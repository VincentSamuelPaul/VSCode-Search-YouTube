# Search Youtube From VSCode

This Extension helps you to search YouTube videos directly from your favorite code editor.

I'm Vincent Samuel Paul, a Full Stack Developer with experience in React, Django, NodeJS, Sql and NoSql DBMS.
I made this as a fun project, to learn about how to build an extension for VS Code.

## Features

Once you've installed the extension run the following simple commands. ~ ("Imma write the commands only for Mac users, windows people i hate you!! ~ sorry")
1. Inside the editor, press (cmd-shift-p).
2. Search for "Search YouTube function".
3. Now, type in the video (title/type/genre/etc) and press Enter
4. Now, a popup opens up asking you to continue to your external browser, click Open or press Enter.
5. You'll be redirected to YouTube with your specific search Results.

## Release Notes

As this a very simple extension and not really functional in real work cases, so there's probably no more updates or releases.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Search YouTube Extension.
